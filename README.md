## Welcome, fellow MIDS students!
As you know, MIDS students enter the program with widely varied backgrounds. This repo is intended to provide learning resources for classes where you might be less familiar with the subject matter. This repo is not intended to teach you the actual MIDS materials, but rather to help you build the foundational knowledge you will need to focus properly on the actual coursework.

## Official Slack
The School of Information (which MIDS is part of) has an official slack channel, [ucbischool.slack.com](https://ucbischool.slack.com). Sign up with your *@ischool.berkeley.edu email and you'll be good to go. This is the primary social area for MIDS students currently.

## How to Contribute
This repository is divided into two general sections: courses and resources. The courses (subfolders begining with W) should be kept at a 1:1 ratio with active courses in the MIDS program. Underneath each, there should only be a syllabus and README. The course README should only contain information directly required by the course; nothing more. For all other helpful resources, please add them to the Resources section by topic.
